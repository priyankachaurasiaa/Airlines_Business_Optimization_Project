Introduction
Navigating Aviation Challenges: Our aviation fleet thrives on passenger satisfaction. Yet, factors like regulations, costs, and competition challenge profitability. Data-Powered Solution: Through precise data analysis, we're optimizing seat occupancy to counter financial pressures and offer exceptional travel. Revitalizing Industry: This project not only boosts per-seat profits but also revolutionizes aviation economics, inviting you to shape a sustainable future with us.

Objectives
Increase Occupancy Rate: -The primary objective is to raise the occupancy rate. Achieving this will directly enhance the average profit per seat, countering the current challenges.

Optimize Pricing Strategy: -Develop a dynamic pricing strategy that adapts to market fluctuations and aligns with customer preferences. This will attract and retain customers effectively.

Elevate Customer Experience: -Prioritize a seamless end-to-end experience for passengers, from booking to arrival. This distinctiveness in a competitive industry will foster customer loyalty.

The ultimate aim of these objectives is to pinpoint avenues for boosting the occupancy rate on flights with lower performance. This targeted effort has the potential to significantly amplify the airline's profitability.

Database and Tables

**List of tables in Database:**
''' ['aircrafts_data',
 'airports_data',
 'boarding_passes',
 'bookings',
 'flights',
 'seats',
 'ticket_flights',
 'tickets']'''
  
Preprocessing and Exploration
Null and Noise Handling: Conducted a thorough assessment to identify and address null values in the dataset. Also, implemented noise reduction techniques to ensure data accuracy.

Data Type Consistency: Ensured uniform data types across the dataset. This consistency aids in smooth processing and analysis.

Table Size and Shape Evaluation: Assessed the size and shape of each table to comprehend its structure. This step is crucial for understanding the data's composition.

By executing these preprocessing steps, the dataset was refined, cleaned, and made ready for further analysis, establishing a solid foundation for accurate insights.
Analysis and Insights

**Basic Analysis**
Q1.How many planes have more than 100 seats?
Q2.How the number of tickets booked and total amount earned changes with the time?
Q3.Calculate the average charges for each aircraft with different fare conditions?

**Analysing Occupancy Rate**
Q4. For each aircraft, calculate the total revenue per year and the average revenue per ticket.
Q5. Calculate the average occupancy per aircraft. (occupanct_rate = booked_seat/available_seat)
Q6. Calculate by how much the total annual turnover could increase by giving all aircraft a 10% higher occupancy rate.

Final Results Final_results

Graphical Comparison: Utilized bar graphs to visually compare average costs across different fare conditions per aircraft.

Fare Types: Observed three fare types: business, economy, and comfort. Comfort class is unique to the 773 aircraft, while CN1 and CR2 planes exclusively offer economy class.

Price Comparison: Noted a consistent pattern where business class charges consistently exceeded economy class charges across all aircraft.

Revenue Analysis for Profit Maximization: Examining overall yearly income and average revenue per ticket is crucial for airlines to optimize profitability. Insights from these metrics guide decisions on aircraft types, itineraries, pricing optimization, and resource allocation.

Revenue and Occupancy Impact: Total revenue, average revenue per ticket, and average occupancy per aircraft are critical indicators. SU9 aircraft leads in total revenue with lower business and economy class prices. CN1 has lower revenue due to offering only economy class at a minimal price.

Occupancy's Role in Revenue: Average occupancy per aircraft reflects how effectively seats are filled. Higher occupancy rates improve revenue, profitability, and operational efficiency. Calculated by dividing booked seats by total seats.

Conclusion
Revenue Data Analysis for Profitability: Analyzing total yearly revenue, average ticket revenue, and aircraft occupancy is vital for maximizing airline profitability. Insights from these metrics guide pricing, route adjustments, and operational improvements.

Occupancy's Role in Profitability: Greater occupancy rates enhance profitability by maximizing revenue and minimizing vacant seat costs. Pricing adjustment based on aircraft condition and facility is crucial for attracting passengers without compromising on quality.

Balancing Profit and Quality: While boosting occupancy is crucial, maintaining customer satisfaction and safety is equally important. Airlines should adopt a data-driven approach to revenue analysis and optimization for sustainable success in a competitive industry.

These summary points underscore the importance of revenue analysis, the role of occupancy in profitability, and the need to balance profit goals with delivering quality service and safety.
